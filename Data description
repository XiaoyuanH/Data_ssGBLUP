This data was simulated using QMSim (Sargolzaei & Schenkel, 2009).
A single trait animal model was assumed, where the additive genetic variance was 0.4 and the residual variance was 0.6.
All the genetic variance was explained by 500 QTL. Animals were genotyped for 45,000 SNP and the average LD was 0.18.
From 12,010 animals in the pedigree, 10,000 have phenotypes and 2024 have genotypes and phenotype. 
Phenotype was generated using the following model: Phenotype = sex_effect + true_breeding_value + residual

phenotypes.txt: animal, sex, phenotype, true breeding value, generation 

pedigree.txt: animal, sire, dam

genotypes.txt: animal, SNP_genotype
SNP_genotype is coded based on the number of copies of the alternative allele (0, 1, 2)

#Simulation details#
Data were simulated using the software QMsim (Sargolzaei and Schenkel, 2009). A single trait with heritability of 0.4 was assumed. 
In the first simulation step, 200 generations of historical population were simulated to create mutation and drift equilibrium and 
linkage disequilibrium (LD). This historical population started from 50,000 individuals and decreased to 2,100 in the last generation, 
with equal proportion of males and females. The second step generated an expansion population, which started off 10 males and 
2000 females from the last historical generation. Each one of the 2000 females was randomly mated and produced 1 offspring per generation. 
Sire and dam were randomly replaced over 20 generations, and the replacement was 50% and 20%, respectively. The third step was used to 
generate the recent population that had the same parameters as the expansion population. Five generations were simulated, 
and all animals were genotytped. Only data from the recent population were used, which comprised pedigree information and phenotypes
for 10,000 animals, and genotypes for 1020 parents from generations 1-4 and 1004 individuals in generation 5.
For the genome, 29 chromosomes with a total of 2319 cM were simulated. Each chromosome had similar number of SNP as the 
BovineSNP50k BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Although the number of simulated SNP was 54,000, nearly 45,000 passed 
the quality control and remained in the analyses. Along with SNP, 500 biallelic QTL were randomly placed on chromosomes. 
The QTL effects were sampled from a gamma distribution.  The QTL and SNP had recurrent mutations with a probability of 2.5 Ã— 10-5.

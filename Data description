This data was simulated using QMSim (Sargolzaei & Schenkel, 2009).
A single trait animal model was assumed, where the additive genetic variance was 0.4 and the residual variance was 0.6.
All the genetic variance was explained by 500 QTL. Animals were genotyped for 45,000 SNP and the average LD was 0.18.
Phenotype was generated using the following model: Phenotype = sex_effect + true_breeding_value + residual

phenotypes.txt: animal, sex, phenotype, true breeding value, generation 

pedigree.txt: animal, sire, dam

genotypes.txt: animal, SNP_genotype
SNP_genotype is coded based on the number of copies of the alternative allele (0, 1, 2)

gen_map.txt: SNP order, chromosome number, position (bp)
